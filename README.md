# ðŸš¢ Titanic Disaster Analysis & Prediction

This project explores the **Titanic Disaster dataset** from Kaggle and applies **Machine Learning techniques** to predict passenger survival.  
It includes **data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation**, and an **interactive Streamlit web app** for predictions.

- `test.csv` â†’ Test dataset (without survival labels)  
- `Titanic Survival Analysis.ipynb` â†’ Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and model building  
- `titanic_streamlit_app.py` â†’ Streamlit app for interactive survival prediction
